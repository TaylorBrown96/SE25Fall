|Notes|Evidence|Score|
|-----|---------|--|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... --| |
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence in GH| |
|Number of commits|in GH| |
|Number of commits: by different people|in GH| |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| |
|Issues are being closed|evidence in GH| |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |in GH| |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)| | |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries| | |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| |
|Use of version control tools| |
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base| |
|Test cases are routinely executed|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something| |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here| |
|Chat channel: exists|Link or screenshots| |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it| |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| |
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| |
